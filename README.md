## Sleep Scoring

![sleep staging](picture/autosleepscorer.png)

We choose a open-source library named `AutoSleepScorer` from https://github.com/skjerns/AutoSleepScorer to carry out the sleep staging process, because it's easy to leverage the pre-train model to test your own dataset.

At the same time, we have another choice: `Deepsleepnet` from https://github.com/akaraspt/deepsleepnet which extracts features from row-EEG, but it lacks a pre-trained model, so we need it train the entire model ourselves.

### 1. Install Anaconda
Download and install Anaconda with Python 3.6 64 bit from https://www.anaconda.com/download/#download

If you already have a working Python 3.x environment you can skip this step.

### 2. Install Tensorflow
Open a command line and install tensorflow via `pip install tensorflow` or via `conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow`.

Personally, I recommend that you install the environment with conda.

### 3. Install AutoSleepScorer
Clone and install this repository via pip:
`pip install git+https://github.com/skjerns/AutoSleepScorer`

If you get an error that`git` is not installed, you can install it using the command line `conda install git`

## **Mini example**

For quick classification

```Python
from sleepscorer import Scorer
file = "eeg_filename" #link to the EEG header or EEG file
scorer = Scorer([file], hypnograms=True)
scorer.run()
```
## **Advanced example**

First we download a sample file from the EDFx database

```Python
from sleepscorer import tools
# download sample EEG file from the EDFx database
tools.download('https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/sleep-edfx/sleep-cassette/SC4001E0-PSG.edf', 'sample-psg.edf')
# download corresponding hypnogram for comparrison of classification
tools.download('https://pastebin.com/raw/jbzz16wP', 'sample-psg.groundtruth.csv') 
```
Now we can start the Scorer using a list of EEG files.
Instead of an EEG-filename we can also set advanced options using a `SleepData` object
```Python
# create a SleepData object 
from sleepscorer import Scorer, SleepData
file = SleepData('sample-psg.edf', start = 2880000, stop = 5400000, 
							  channels={'EEG':'EEG Fpz-Cz', 'EMG':'EMG submental', 
                              			'EOG':'EOG horizontal'}, preload=False)
# Create and run Scorer
scorer = Scorer([file], hypnograms=True, demo=True)
scorer.run()
# this will only work if you have matplotlib set-up
tools.show_sample_hypnogram('sample-psg.groundtruth.csv', start=960, stop=1800)
```
The predictions will now be saved as `sample-psg.edf.csv`, where each row corresponds to one epoch (0=W, 1=S1, 2=S2, 3=SWS, 4=REM).

## **Example for Biosignal+**

We can collect data from Biosignal plus which contains signals EEG, ECG, and EMG, but this machine cannot collect EOG datas, so the first solution is to replace EOG with ECG, but it affects the performance of our sleep staging algorithm, and we'd like to retrain a new neural network in the future. What's more we can export the data in the format .txt or in the format .edf. And in this part, we provide a peace of code to handle the txt files. Data needs to be sampled with 100 Hz. EEG and EOG are high-pass filtered with 0.15 Hz and the EMG has a high-pass filter of 10 Hz. Data needs to be in the format `[epochs, 3000, 3]` where the last dimension is EEG, EMG and EOG.
```Python
from sleepscorer import Classifier
import numpy as np
bio_signal_plus = np.loadtxt("bio_signal_plus.txt")
# replace with your channel number in the matrix
test = bio_signal_plus[:,["channel one","channel two","channel three"]]
data = test.reshape((epochs,3000,3))
assert(data.ndim==3 and data.shape[1:]==(3000,3))

clf = Classifier()
clf.download_weights()  # skip this if you already downloaded them.
clf.load_cnn_model('./weights/cnn.hdf5')
clf.load_rnn_model('./weights/rnn.hdf5)
preds = clf.predict(data, classes=True)
```

## Core data from SHHS 
We can find a well-processed dataset from https://sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs/files/datasets which contains `5804` rows and `1279` columns. But the problem is that if you need write an application to get this dataset. If you want to get more details, you can have a look at our project report here: ![Report for sleep quality](Projet_ISA.pdf)

### 1. Install Numpy
Download and install Numpy from https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html

### 2. Install Pandas
Download and install Pandas from https://pandas.pydata.org/

## **Mini example**

For some authorization reasons, we can't put the data set here, we can only provide the code for processing.

In order to get an available dataset for the next training step, we need to do data cleaning and feature engineering:
```Python
# Data cleaning
python3 preprocessing.py
```
Now you get a new dataset named `SleepQuality_After_Cleaning.csv`

Next, we're going to do aggregations, we provide two method who convert 5 criterias to 3 criterias and 5 criterias to 1 criterias, for example:
* for sleep quality light/deep: `ranting 1-5` to `ranting 1-3`, here `1` represent `bad sleep`, `2` represent `normal sleep`, and `3` represent `good sleep`
```Python
# rating 5 -> rating 3
python3 ranting5_to_3.py
```
* for sleep quality light/deep: `ranting 1-5` to `ranting 1-2`, here `1` represent `bad sleep`, and `2` represent `good sleep`
```Python
# rating 5 -> rating 2
python3 ranting5_to_2.py
```

## Modeling
During this project, we use three models:
* Deep Neural Network 
* Random Forest
* lightGBM

Below is the performance of each model in 3-criteria model :
