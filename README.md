# Sleep Quality By Polysomnography

> Haipeng LI, Lucas MONTI

## Introduction
Our project is divided into three phases:
1. Convert row polysomnography signals to sleep stages.
2. Data mining process on SHHS core datas.
3. Design of sleep quality evaluation model
## Getting Started


## Sleep Dataset

## Sleep Scoring

We choose a open-source library named `AutoSleepScorer` from https://github.com/skjerns/AutoSleepScorer to carry out the sleep staging process, because it's easy to leverage the pre-train model to test your own dataset.

At the same time, we have another choice: `Deepsleepnet` from https://github.com/akaraspt/deepsleepnet which extracts features from row-EEG, but it lacks a pre-trained model, so we need it train the entire model ourselves.

### 1. Install Anaconda
Download and install Anaconda with Python 3.6 64 bit from https://www.anaconda.com/download/#download

If you already have a working Python 3.x environment with Anaconda you can skip this step.

### 2. Install Git
To install git, use: `conda install git`

### 3. Set a Virtual Environment
Open a command line and input: `conda create -n your_env_name python=3.6`.

To activate this environment, use: `source activate your_env_name`

To deactivate an active environment, use: `source deactivate`

### 3. Configure the Environment
#### requisites

```
Python3
Keras
Tensorflow
Numpy
Pandas
Sklearn
Matplotlib
```
Firstly clone our project: `git clone https://github.com/lhaippp/Measuring-Sleep-Quality` 

Next enter the project: `cd Measuring-Sleep-Quality`

To configure the environment, use `chmod +x set-environment.sh` and `source set-environment.sh`

If success, you'll see a result like below:
```
****************************************************************
Congratulations! All the environment are installed successfully
****************************************************************
Now you can view and edit the project!
****************************************************************
```

### 3. Install AutoSleepScorer
Clone and install this repository via pip:
`pip install git+https://github.com/skjerns/AutoSleepScorer`


## **Mini example**

First we download a sample file from the EDFx database

```Python
from sleepscorer import tools
# download sample EEG file from the EDFx database
tools.download('https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/sleep-edfx/sleep-cassette/SC4001E0-PSG.edf', 'sample-psg.edf')
# download corresponding hypnogram for comparrison of classification
tools.download('https://pastebin.com/raw/jbzz16wP', 'sample-psg.groundtruth.csv') 
```
Now we can start the Scorer using a list of EEG files.
Instead of an EEG-filename we can also set advanced options using a `SleepData` object
```Python
# create a SleepData object 
from sleepscorer import tools
from sleepscorer import Scorer, SleepData
file = SleepData('sample-psg.edf', start = 2880000, stop = 5400000, 
							  channels={'EEG':'EEG Fpz-Cz', 'EMG':'EMG submental', 
                              			'EOG':'EOG horizontal'}, preload=False)
# Create and run Scorer
scorer = Scorer([file], hypnograms=True, demo=True)
scorer.run()
# this will only work if you have matplotlib set-up
tools.show_sample_hypnogram('sample-psg.groundtruth.csv', start=960, stop=1800)
```
The predictions will now be saved as `sample-psg.edf.csv`, where each row corresponds to one epoch (0=W, 1=S1, 2=S2, 3=SWS, 4=REM).

## **Classification example**

First of all, we need to open jupyter notebook, because we want to see the result of sleep staging: `jupyter notebook`. Then create a python3 file

For quick classification

```Python
from sleepscorer import Scorer
file = "eeg_filename" #link to the EEG header or EEG file
scorer = Scorer([file], hypnograms=True)
scorer.run()
```

## Core data from SHHS 
We can find a well-processed dataset from https://sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs/files/datasets which contains `5804` rows and `1279` columns. But the problem is that if you need write an application to get this dataset. If you want to get more details, you can have a look at our project report here: XXXXXXXX


## **Mini example**

For some authorization reasons, we can't put the data set here, we can only provide the code for processing.

In order to get an available dataset for the next training step, we need to do data cleaning and feature engineering:
```Python
# Data cleaning
python3 preprocessing.py
```
Now you get a new dataset named `SleepQuality_After_Cleaning.csv`

Next, we're going to do aggregations, we provide two method who convert 5 criterias to 3 criterias and 5 criterias to 1 criterias, for example:
* for sleep quality light/deep: `ranting 1-5` to `ranting 1-3`, here `1` represent `bad sleep`, `2` represent `normal sleep`, and `3` represent `good sleep`
```Python
# rating 5 -> rating 3
python3 ranting5_to_3.py
```
* for sleep quality light/deep: `ranting 1-5` to `ranting 1-2`, here `1` represent `bad sleep`, and `2` represent `good sleep`
```Python
# rating 5 -> rating 2
python3 ranting5_to_2.py
```

## Modeling
During this project, we use three models:
* Deep Neural Network 
* Random Forest
* lightGBM

Below is the performance of each model in 3-criteria model :
